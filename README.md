## Overview

This is my solution to the final challenge of day 21. The CRL course is great for beginners like me trying to get into HTML & CSS by creating responsive websites.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Mimic the figma file
- Create a mobile, tablet and desktop version

## My process

Like Kevin said in his courses. Tackle challenges step by step and that is what I did. I started at the header and worked my way down the page.
I looked at the desktop version to get the layout and the markup right but I worked with a mobile first approach. This helped me make the website responsive. 

First I work on the HTML and layout of each section and then afterwards I will style it. The hover and focus effects are added last.

The last parst was adding the media queries in. I kept in mind where I needed to have responsive parts and coded the HTML markup with that in mind. I also added a hamburger icon leading the a aside section. This was a challenge because I had never done it before. I used only HTML & CSS to do this, no JavaScript since I still need to start learning that.

### Built with

### What I learned

- CSS custom properties
- Data-icon
- The iframe element
- Creating an aside section with a hamburger icon linking to it.
- Better understanding of CSS flexbox
- Using simple media queries using a mobile-first workflow
- Understanding different CSS resets
- Assisigning better names to my classes


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - Great youtuber explaining basic HTML & CSS
- [Example resource 2](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/) - The Conquering Responsive Layouts course, was my first introduction to responsive layouts. This gave me a basic understanding if responsive web layouts and media queries.
